A modern About Box for an Android App built on the [daniel-stoneuk/material-about-library](https://github.com/daniel-stoneuk/material-about-library).

### Easily display the common items of an About Box in a modern Android friendly way

## About

Android About Box is configured with a set of (mostly) strings for the company name, twitter and Facebook accounts, website, and filenames to html files for help files, privacy policy etc.  

When triggered from a menu item, it will display the app name, icon and version, provide links to contact support, leave a review, share the app, go to other apps by the same company in the app store -- as well as links to Facebook etc.
